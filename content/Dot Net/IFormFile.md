### What is `IFormFile`?

`IFormFile` is an interface in ASP.NET Core that is used to handle file uploads in web applications. It represents a file sent with an HTTP request, typically as part of a form submission.

### When to Use `IFormFile`?

- **Handling File Uploads in Web Applications**: `IFormFile` is ideal for scenarios where you need to handle file uploads in an ASP.NET Core web application. For example, when a user uploads a file through a form, you can use `IFormFile` to access the file's content, name, and metadata.
    
- **Processing Files Directly**: `IFormFile` allows you to read the contents of the uploaded file directly using streams. This is useful when you need to save the file to a server, process its contents, or store it in a database.

زمانی ازش استفاده میشه که بخوایم اون فایلی که آپلود شده رو بخوایم توی دیتابیس ذخیره کنیم یا بخوایم پردازشش کنیم 
### When Not to Use `IFormFile`?

- **Large File Uploads**: `IFormFile` keeps the file in memory, which might not be suitable for very large files as it could lead to performance issues or even memory exhaustion. For handling large files, consider alternatives like **streaming uploads**.
    
- **API Clients**: If you're building a client application that needs to send files to an API, `IFormFile` is not suitable on the client side. Instead, you would use classes like `HttpClient` in combination with `MultipartFormDataContent` to upload files.
